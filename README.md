# Round Robin Scheduling

## Project Requirements

- This is an implemenation of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm (just a simulation) with Python.
- GUI is a must for the project (Gantt Chart is provided).
- Number of processes is to be user-defined (i.e. user enters them at run time). 
- All process data (i.e. process arrival time, burst time) is user defined.
- Validation for the input data must be considered (i.e. canâ€™t enter negative numbers, or characters in the input fields). 
- Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Response Time for each process should be calculated. 
- Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, and Average Response Time should be calculated.
